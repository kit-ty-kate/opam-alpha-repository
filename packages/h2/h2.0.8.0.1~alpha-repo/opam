synopsis:
  "A high-performance, memory-efficient, and scalable HTTP/2 library for OCaml"
description: """\
h2 is an implementation of the HTTP/2 specification entirely in OCaml. It
is based on the concepts in http/af, and therefore uses the Angstrom and
Faraday libraries to implement the parsing and serialization layers of the
HTTP/2 standard as a state machine that is agnostic to the underlying I/O
specifics. It also preserves the same API as http/af wherever possible."""
